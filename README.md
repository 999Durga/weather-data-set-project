# weather-data-set-project
This project uses a weather dataset with daily observations like temperature, rainfall, wind, and humidity.  

The dataset includes 366 rows and 22 columns, covering various meteorological features.

It aims to analyze the data and prepare it for machine learning tasks.

The target variable `RainTomorrow` helps predict whether it will rain the next day. 

Missing values are identified and can be handled through preprocessing.

Basic data exploration is performed using Python and pandas. 

The dataset is suitable for classification and regression problems.  

Wind directions, speeds, and pressure readings provide rich features for modeling.

This project is ideal for beginners in data science or weather analysis.

Notebook and dataset are included for easy use and extension.
